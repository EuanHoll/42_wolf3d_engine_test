# Wolf3D Engine Test

A C-language engine test for the Wolf3D project from 42. This is a ray casting engine, similar to the one used in the original Wolfenstein game. In the Wolf3D project, I received 125% completion, with 25% being bonus objectives.

I later finished the Wolf3D project in collaboration with Pepijn Holster (https://gitlab.com/Eathox).

## Description

Ray casting is a rendering technique used to create a 3D perspective in a 2D environment. It involves casting rays from the viewpoint of the player and determining which objects in the scene are intersected by those rays. By calculating the distance to these objects, the engine is able to accurately depict the spatial relationships and visual perspective of the scene.

## Build

To compile the project, use the following command in the terminal:
```bash
make
```

## Usage

To run the engine test, enter the following command in the terminal:
```bash
./wolf3d
```

## Libraries Used

- 42's MiniLibx: https://github.com/pbondoer/MinilibX
- My own Libft library: https://github.com/EuanHoll/42_libft
